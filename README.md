# Movie-Database-Project

This project involves integrating movie and people data into a MySQL database (imdb), loading supplemental data from CSV files using Python, and performing various queries and transformations to prepare the data for analysis. The project also includes tracking package deliveries in a separate packaroo database and extracting reports from CSV and SQL sources.
